**Generating pi from coprimes**


Theoretical background:
The propability of two integers being coprime is ![pi^2/6](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/m/Probability/TwoCoprime.shtml)
Therefore pi is equal to sqrt(6/x), where x is the proportion of coprimes among all pairs of integers.


I used R to generate pairs of random integers and calcu
